# food-warehouse-server

## Brief Description

We want to design an application that will support and facilitate the process of managing a food warehouse.
This is the `server-side` of our application. Client side of project can be found [here](https://github.com/A640/food-warehouse-client)

The aim of the project is to design and create a management system for
food warehouse. It should facilitate warehouse management
through the possibility of checking the inventory levels of individual products,
handling orders, issuing invoices, displaying alerts on situations such as e.g.  low inventory levels of a given product or ending expiration date, generating sell statistics, avoiding food expiry by automatic discount applying for products with short expiration dates,
simplifying and improving contact with the customer by enabling him to place and manage orders
directly in the program as well as tracking the status of every order.
